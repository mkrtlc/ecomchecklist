## Why most “audits” fail

A lot of audits are really just:

- A long list of best practices
- A slideshow of opinions
- A UI critique with no revenue model

The problem: best practices don’t tell you **what to do next**. In e-commerce, the best fix is the one that addresses your *specific* leak in the funnel, for your *specific* traffic mix, product type, price point, and customer objections.

This playbook is designed to be run quickly, repeated quarterly, and turned into an execution plan.

---

## The audit mindset: diagnose before you prescribe

Your job in an audit is to answer three questions:

1. **Where is the biggest leak?** (Which funnel step is underperforming?)
2. **Why is it leaking?** (What’s the root cause?)
3. **What’s the simplest fix with the highest expected impact?**

A useful heuristic: *If you can’t articulate the customer’s objection in plain language, you don’t have a diagnosis yet.*

## The 90-minute audit (high leverage)

### 0) Prep (5 minutes)

Gather:

- Analytics access (GA4 or equivalent)
- Store platform access (Shopify/Checkout settings)
- Heatmaps/session recordings (if available)
- Speed reports (PageSpeed Insights / CrUX)
- Ad landing pages (top 5 by spend)

Create a simple notes doc with these headings:

- Data integrity
- Funnel performance
- Landing page alignment
- PLP (collection) experience
- PDP experience
- Cart + checkout
- Performance
- Trust + policies
- Retention basics
- Prioritized actions

---

## 1) Data integrity check (10 minutes)

Before you analyze behavior, confirm your tracking is not lying.

### What to verify

**Events and revenue sanity**

- Does “purchase” fire once per order?
- Is revenue close to backend revenue (allowing for attribution/cookie loss)?
- Are taxes/shipping included or excluded consistently?

**Funnel event coverage**

You should reliably track:

- view_item
- add_to_cart
- begin_checkout
- add_payment_info
- purchase

**UTM standards**

- Are UTMs present on paid traffic?
- Are “source / medium” buckets clean?

### Common failure modes

- Duplicated purchase events inflate conversion
- Missing checkout events hides leaks
- Payment step tracked as checkout start (false funnel)
- Consent/cookie banner breaks analytics

If data is broken, fix this first. Everything else will be noise.

---

## 2) Funnel audit (15 minutes)

### The minimum funnel views to check

Look at conversion rates for:

- Session → Product view
- Product view → Add to cart
- Add to cart → Begin checkout
- Begin checkout → Purchase

Then segment by:

- Mobile vs desktop
- New vs returning
- Top 3 channels
- Top 3 landing pages
- Top countries (if international)

### What the funnel tells you

- **Low product view rate**: traffic mismatch or weak landing pages
- **Low add-to-cart**: PDP clarity, trust, price/value mismatch, poor variants
- **Low checkout start**: cart friction, surprise costs, weak CTAs
- **Low purchase**: checkout friction, payments, delivery mismatch, lack of trust

The goal: pick **one primary leak** and **one secondary leak**.

---

## 3) Landing page alignment (10 minutes)

Paid traffic usually lands on a promise: an ad angle, a creator story, a benefit.

### The alignment checklist

For your top landing pages, ask:

- Does the headline repeat the ad promise?
- Is the product shown immediately?
- Is pricing clear fast?
- Is the primary CTA obvious?
- Is there proof *above the fold*?

### Fast wins

- Add a “you are in the right place” hero
- Repeat the key claim with 2–3 bullets
- Show delivery time + returns near CTA
- Add one strong proof block (reviews, UGC, results)

---

## 4) Collection (PLP) audit (10 minutes)

PLPs are often ignored, yet they’re the decision hub for shoppers.

### What great PLPs do

- Let users filter by real buying criteria
- Make differences between products obvious
- Provide fast scanning (price, rating, key attributes)

### PLP audit checklist

- [ ] Sorting options include Best sellers, New, Price
- [ ] Filters match category (size, material, use case)
- [ ] Product cards show key differentiators
- [ ] Quick-add is available where appropriate
- [ ] Pagination/infinite scroll doesn’t break performance

---

## 5) Product page (PDP) audit (20 minutes)

Your PDP must do three things:

1. Explain value quickly
2. Build confidence
3. Remove friction

### The “10-second clarity” test

In 10 seconds, can a new visitor answer:

- What is it?
- Why should I care?
- What’s included?
- What does it cost?
- How fast can I get it?

### The “objection mapping” method

Write down the top objections for your category. Examples:

- “Will this fit me?”
- “Will this actually work?”
- “Is this legit?”
- “Can I return it?”
- “Why is it this price?”
- “How does it compare?”

Then ensure the PDP answers each objection explicitly.

### PDP checklist (high impact)

**Above the fold**

- [ ] Clear headline (benefit-focused)
- [ ] Price + any subscription/upsell clarity
- [ ] Variant selection is obvious
- [ ] Shipping ETA + returns summary
- [ ] Reviews summary (count + rating)

**Mid-page**

- [ ] How it works (visual steps)
- [ ] Benefits + features (separate)
- [ ] Social proof with context
- [ ] Comparison vs alternatives

**Bottom**

- [ ] FAQ based on real support questions
- [ ] Policies in plain language
- [ ] Trust badges only if meaningful

---

## 6) Cart and checkout audit (15 minutes)

Checkout is the highest intent environment on your site. Small frictions matter.

### Cart audit checklist

- [ ] Shipping costs and ETA visible early
- [ ] Upsells don’t distract from checkout
- [ ] Coupon field not overly prominent
- [ ] Express checkout available

### Checkout audit checklist

- [ ] Guest checkout allowed
- [ ] Apple Pay / Google Pay / PayPal enabled
- [ ] Address autocomplete enabled
- [ ] Errors are clear and field-specific
- [ ] Payment failures are handled gracefully

### Red flags

- Surprise shipping costs at the last step
- Too many form fields on mobile
- Payment methods missing for key regions
- Long “loading” states with no feedback

---

## 7) Performance audit (10 minutes)

Performance issues are silent conversion killers.

What to check:

- Mobile PageSpeed for top landing pages and PDPs
- Largest image sizes (hero, gallery)
- Third-party script weight (apps, chat widgets, A/B tools)
- Layout shift from banners/review widgets

Quick wins:

- Compress images and fix dimensions
- Remove or delay non-critical scripts
- Reduce app bloat

---

## 8) Trust + policy audit (5 minutes)

Trust is rarely one big thing. It’s the sum of details.

Checklist:

- [ ] Clear contact methods (not hidden)
- [ ] Returns policy written in plain language
- [ ] Shipping times realistic and consistent
- [ ] Security/reliability signals at checkout
- [ ] Review authenticity (no obvious spam)

---

## 9) Turn findings into a 30-day plan (the part most teams skip)

An audit that doesn’t produce a plan is just entertainment.

### Prioritization framework: ICE with a constraint

For each idea, score:

- **Impact** (1–10): expected conversion or revenue lift
- **Confidence** (1–10): evidence quality
- **Effort** (1–10): design/dev/ops effort

Compute: (Impact × Confidence) / Effort.

Then apply a constraint:

- Choose **one “primary leak” project**
- Choose **two “quick wins”**
- Choose **one measurement/QA improvement**

This prevents “death by 37 small changes.”

### Example 30-day plan

**Week 1: diagnose + ship quick wins**

- Fix shipping ETA clarity on PDP and cart
- Add above-the-fold proof block
- Clean up variant selection UI

**Week 2: checkout friction**

- Enable express pay
- Improve error messaging
- Add address autocomplete

**Week 3: performance cleanup**

- Compress hero and gallery images
- Remove 1–2 heavy scripts

**Week 4: run one structured experiment**

- Test a new PDP above-the-fold module
- Measure impact on add-to-cart and purchase

---

## Templates you can reuse

### Audit deliverable template

For each section, include:

- Observation (what you saw)
- Evidence (data, screenshots, recordings)
- Diagnosis (why it’s happening)
- Recommendation (what to change)
- Expected impact (qualitative)
- Owner and effort estimate

### The “root cause” prompt

When you’re unsure, ask:

- What does the user want to do here?
- What is stopping them?
- What are they afraid of?
- What is unclear?
- What feels risky?

---

## Add-on: a simple audit scorecard (so you can compare quarter to quarter)

If you want your audits to compound, turn them into a scorecard.

Score each area 1–5:

- Measurement integrity
- Landing page alignment
- PLP discoverability
- PDP clarity
- PDP trust
- Cart clarity
- Checkout friction
- Mobile performance
- Post-purchase basics

Then track the score quarterly. You’ll quickly see whether you’re actually improving or just shipping random changes.

---

## Add-on: symptom → likely root cause patterns

When you run enough audits, patterns repeat.

### Symptom: high traffic, low add-to-cart

Likely causes:

- product value unclear above the fold
- price/value mismatch for traffic source
- weak proof near CTA
- variant selection confusion
- shipping/returns uncertainty

### Symptom: strong add-to-cart, weak purchase

Likely causes:

- surprise shipping costs or long delivery times
- missing payment methods
- checkout errors on mobile
- discount field increases “coupon hunting”

### Symptom: desktop converts, mobile doesn’t

Likely causes:

- performance (LCP/INP)
- sticky elements covering CTAs
- form friction in checkout
- too much content before the CTA

Use these patterns to speed up diagnosis—but still confirm with evidence.

---

## Deep dive: diagnosing the root cause (not the symptom)

Once you’ve identified the primary leak (for example: **begin checkout → purchase** is weak on mobile), don’t jump straight to “add more trust badges.” Use a structured diagnosis.

### Root-cause categories (use these like a checklist)

Most issues fall into a small set of buckets:

1. **Clarity problems** (people don’t understand the product/offer)
2. **Risk problems** (trust, returns, warranties, legitimacy)
3. **Friction problems** (UX, forms, speed, errors)
4. **Cost surprises** (shipping, taxes, duties, subscriptions)
5. **Fit problems** (size, compatibility, ingredients/material concerns)
6. **Payment or delivery mismatch** (missing local methods, slow/uncertain shipping)
7. **Audience mismatch** (traffic is the wrong intent, wrong promise, wrong segment)

Your goal is to label the leak with *one* primary root cause before proposing solutions.

### Example: checkout drop-off

**Symptom:** Mobile checkout completion is down, especially for paid social.

**Evidence to collect:**

- Payment failure rate by method (Shop Pay vs card vs PayPal)
- Form error rates (postcode, phone, address line)
- Session recordings focused on checkout
- Time-to-complete checkout (median)

**Likely root causes:**

- Address autocomplete missing on mobile
- Payment method mismatch for the country
- Discount hunting caused by an overly prominent coupon field
- Shipping shown too late (surprise cost)

**Actionable fix types:**

- Reduce required fields, improve inline validation
- Add the 2–3 most demanded payment methods for your top countries
- Show shipping cost + ETA earlier (even a range)

---

## How to package evidence so stakeholders say “yes”

Audits die when they’re delivered as opinions. For every recommendation, attach an **evidence pack**:

- **1 screenshot** of the issue (or competitor reference)
- **1 metric** that shows it matters (funnel rate, drop-off %, error rate)
- **1 recording note** (what real users are doing)
- **1 proposed change** with expected impact and effort

If you do this consistently, your audit becomes a decision-making tool, not a design critique.

### A simple severity rubric

To avoid endless debates, rate each finding:

- **Severity A:** clearly blocking purchase (broken buttons, payment failures, missing shipping rates)
- **Severity B:** major friction or clarity gap (variant confusion, unclear returns, slow LCP)
- **Severity C:** polish or long-term improvement (small UI consistency, minor content gaps)

Ship A’s immediately, schedule B’s, backlog C’s.

---

## The “one-page audit summary” (what leadership actually reads)

Create a short summary page with:

1. **Primary leak + diagnosis** (one sentence)
2. **Top 3 fixes** (what, why, expected impact, effort)
3. **Risks / dependencies** (apps, theme changes, dev constraints)
4. **30-day plan** (weekly milestones)

Then link the deep audit doc below it for the team.

---

## Final note

The best audit is the one you can repeat.

Run this quarterly, keep a running backlog, and track which changes actually move the funnel. Over time you’ll build a compounding advantage: you’ll stop guessing, and you’ll start operating your store like a system.
